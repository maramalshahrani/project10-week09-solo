// Tips Page
"tips" = "Tips";
"tip_1_titel" = "How to Start Exercising and Stick to It";
"tip_1_desc" = "If you‚Äôre having trouble beginning an exercise plan or following through, you‚Äôre not alone. Many of us struggle getting out of the sedentary rut, despite our best intentions.
                                
You already know there are many great reasons to exercise‚Äîfrom improving energy, mood, sleep, and health to reducing anxiety, stress, and depression. And detailed exercise instructions and workout plans are just a click away. But if knowing how and why to exercise was enough, we‚Äôd all be in shape. Making exercise a habit takes more‚Äîyou need the right mindset and a smart approach.
                                
While practical concerns like a busy schedule or poor health can make exercise more challenging, for most of us, the biggest barriers are mental. Maybe it‚Äôs a lack of self-confidence that keeps you from taking positive steps, or your motivation quickly flames out, or you get easily discouraged and give up. We‚Äôve all been there at some point.
                                
Whatever your age or fitness level‚Äîeven if you‚Äôve never exercised a day in your life ‚Äîthere are steps you can take to make exercise less intimidating and painful and more fun and instinctive.
                                
Ditch the all-or-nothing attitude. You don‚Äôt have to spend hours in a gym or force yourself into monotonous or painful activities you hate to experience the physical and emotional benefits of exercise. A little exercise is better than nothing. In fact, adding just modest amounts of physical activity to your weekly routine can have a profound effect on your mental and emotional health.
                                
Be kind to yourself. Research shows that self-compassion increases the likelihood that you‚Äôll succeed in any given endeavor. So, don‚Äôt beat yourself up about your body, your current fitness level, or your supposed lack of willpower. All that will do is demotivate you. Instead, look at your past mistakes and unhealthy choices as opportunities to learn and grow.
                                
Check your expectations. You didn‚Äôt get out of shape overnight, and you‚Äôre not going to instantly transform your body either. Expecting too much, too soon only leads to frustration. Try not to be discouraged by what you can‚Äôt accomplish or how far you have to go to reach your fitness goals. Instead of obsessing over results, focus on consistency. While the improvements in mood and energy levels may happen quickly, the physical payoff will come in time.";

"tip_2_titel" = "Making exercise more enjoyable.";
"tip_2_desc" = "As previously noted, you are much more likely to stick with an exercise program that‚Äôs fun and rewarding. No amount of willpower is going to keep you going long-term with a workout you hate.
                                            
Think outside the gym
Does the thought of going to the gym fill you with dread? If you find the gym inconvenient, expensive, intimidating, or simply boring, that‚Äôs okay. There are many exercise alternatives to weight rooms and cardio equipment.
                                            
For many, simply getting outside makes all the difference. You may enjoy running outdoors, where you can enjoy alone time and nature, even if you hate treadmills.
                                            
Just about everyone can find a physical activity they enjoy. But you may need to think beyond the standard running, swimming, and biking options. Here are a few activities you may find fun:
                                            
1.horseback riding
2.ballroom dancing
3.rollerblading
4.hiking
5.paddle boarding
6.kayaking
7.gymnastics
8.martial arts
9.rock climbing
10.Zumba
11.Ultimate Frisbee
12.fencing
                                            
Make it a game
Activity-based video games such as those from Wii and Kinect can be a fun way to start moving. So-called ‚Äúexergames‚Äù that are played standing up and moving around‚Äîsimulating dancing, skateboarding, soccer, bowling, or tennis, for example‚Äîcan burn at least as many calories as walking on a treadmill; some substantially more. Once you build up your confidence, try getting away from the TV screen and playing the real thing outside. Or use a smartphone app to keep your workouts fun and interesting‚Äîsome immerse you in interactive stories to keep you motivated, such as running from hordes of zombies!

Pair it with something you enjoy
Think about activities that you enjoy and how you can incorporate them into an exercise routine. Watch TV as you ride a stationary bike, chat with a friend as you walk, take photographs on a scenic hike, walk the golf course instead of using a cart, or dance to music as you do household chores.
                                            
Make it social
Exercise can be a fun time to socialize with friends and working out with others can help keep you motivated. For those who enjoy company but dislike competition, a running club, water aerobics, or dance class may be the perfect thing. Others may find that a little healthy competition keeps the workout fun and exciting. You might seek out tennis partners, join an adult soccer league, find a regular pickup basketball game, or join a volleyball team.
                                            
Try a mindfulness approach
Instead of zoning out or distracting yourself when you exercise, try to pay attention to your body. By really focusing on how your body feels as you exercise‚Äîthe rhythm of your breathing, the way your feet strike the ground, your muscles flexing as you move, even the way you feel on the inside‚Äîyou‚Äôll not only improve your physical condition faster but also interrupt the flow of worries or negative thoughts running through your head, easing stress and anxiety. Exercising in this way can also help your nervous system become ‚Äúunstuck‚Äù and begin to move out of the immobilization stress response that characterizes PTSD and trauma. Activities that engage both your arms and legs‚Äîsuch as walking (especially in sand), running, swimming, weight training, rock climbing, skiing, or dancing‚Äîare great choices for practicing mindfulness.";
"tip_3_titel" = "Stay motivated to exercise.";
"tip_3_desc" = "No matter how much you enjoy an exercise routine, you may find that you eventually lose interest in it. That‚Äôs the time to shake things up and try something new or alter the way you pursue the exercises that have worked so far.

Pair your workout with a treat. For example, you can listen to an audiobook or watch your favorite TV show while on the treadmill or stationary bike.

Log your activity. Keep a record of your workouts and fitness progress. Writing things down or tracking them on an app increases commitment and holds you accountable to your routine. Later on, it will also be encouraging to look back at where you began.

Harness the power of the community. Having others rooting for us and supporting us through exercise ups and downs helps to keep motivation strong. There are numerous online fitness communities you can join. You can also try working out with friends either in person or remotely using fitness apps that let you track and compare your progress with each other.

Get inspired. Read a health and fitness magazine or visit an exercise website and get inspired with photos of people being active. Sometimes reading about and looking at images of people who are healthy and fit can motivate you to move your body.
